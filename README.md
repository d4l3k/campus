A interactive map for UBC.

## Inspiration

The existing "wayfinding" site for the University of British Columbia is awful, and thus a more modern replacement is needed. This is designed to be similar to the amazing internal Google app "Campus".

This allows you to easily find any room on the University of British Columbia campus as well as other points of interest such as printers, restrooms, bookable project rooms and restaurants.

There is support for rendering dynamic content directly into the search results. Currently there is direct room booking, as well as in-lining pictures of buildings.

## Technology
